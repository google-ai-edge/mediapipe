// Given a path to a resource, this function attempts to provide an absolute
// path with which it can be accessed as a file.
// - If the input path is an absolute path, it is returned as-is.
// - If the input path is relative, it is searched in a platform-specific
//   location:
//   - On Android, we look for an asset with the given relative path; if
//     it exists, it is copied to the file system (using the AssetCache),
//     and a path to that file is returned.
//   - On iOS, we look for a resource with the given relative path in the
//     application bundle.
//
// Note: The exact search algorithm is subject to change.
// Note: This function should be used by code that needs a resource to be
// accessible as a normal file, usually to call an existing API that only
// accepts file paths. Code that can access data as a stream or as a buffer
// should read from an asset directly on Android; an API for this will be
// provided later. TODO.
