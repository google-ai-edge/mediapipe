  // call stack of the current thread, until the scope is left. Creating
  // another Scoped instance deeper in the call stack applies to calls branching
  // from that point, and the previous value is restored when execution leaves
  // that scope, as one would expect.

  // This is only meant to be used where backwards compatibility reasons prevent
  // passing the CC directly. Specifically, it can be used to access
  // CalculatorContext and CalculatorContract from legacy calculator code.
