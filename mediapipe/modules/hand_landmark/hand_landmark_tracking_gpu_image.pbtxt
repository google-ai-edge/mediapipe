# MediaPipe graph to detect/predict hand landmarks on GPU.
#
# The procedure is done in two steps:
# - locate palms/hands
# - detect landmarks for each palm/hand.
# This graph tries to skip palm detection as much as possible by reusing
# previously detected/predicted landmarks for new images.

# Collection of detected/predicted hands, each represented as a list of
# landmarks. (std::vector<NormalizedLandmarkList>)
# NOTE: there will not be an output packet in the LANDMARKS stream for this
# particular timestamp if none of hands detected. However, the MediaPipe
# framework will internally inform the downstream calculators of the absence of
# this packet so that they don't wait for it unnecessarily.

# Collection of handedness of the detected hands (i.e. is hand left or right),

# Note that handedness is determined assuming the input image is mirrored,
# i.e., taken with a front-facing/selfie camera with images flipped
# horizontally.

# If the source images are on gpu, flip the data vertically before sending them

# MediaPipe in general assumes the image origin is at the top-left corner.
