## Get started

You can get started with MediaPipe Solutions by by checking out any of the
developer guides for
[vision](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/object_detector),
[text](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/text/text_classifier),
and
[audio](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/audio/audio_classifier)
tasks. If you need help setting up a development environment for use with
MediaPipe Tasks, check out the setup guides for
[Android](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_android), [web
apps](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web), and
[Python](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_python).

## Solutions

MediaPipe Solutions provides a suite of libraries and tools for you to quickly
apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in your
applications. You can plug these solutions into your applications immediately,
customize them to your needs, and use them across multiple development
platforms. MediaPipe Solutions is part of the MediaPipe [open source
project](https://github.com/google/mediapipe), so you can further customize the
solutions code to meet your application needs.

These libraries and resources provide the core functionality for each MediaPipe
Solution:

*   **MediaPipe Tasks**: Cross-platform APIs and libraries for deploying
    solutions. [Learn
    more](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/tasks).
*   **MediaPipe models**: Pre-trained, ready-to-run models for use with each
    solution.

These tools let you customize and evaluate solutions:

*   **MediaPipe Model Maker**: Customize models for solutions with your data.
    [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/model_maker).
*   **MediaPipe Studio**: Visualize, evaluate, and benchmark solutions in your
    browser. [Learn
    more](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/studio).

### Legacy solutions

We have ended support for [these MediaPipe Legacy Solutions](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide#legacy)
as of March 1, 2023. All other MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will be upgraded to
a new MediaPipe Solution. See the [Solutions guide](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide#legacy)
for details. The [code repository](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe)
and prebuilt binaries for all MediaPipe Legacy Solutions will continue to be
provided on an as-is basis.

For more on the legacy solutions, see the [documentation](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/docs/solutions).

## Framework

To start using MediaPipe Framework, [install MediaPipe
Framework](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework/getting_started/install)
and start building example applications in C++, Android, and iOS.

[MediaPipe Framework](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/framework) is the
low-level component used to build efficient on-device machine learning
pipelines, similar to the premade MediaPipe Solutions.

Before using MediaPipe Framework, familiarize yourself with the following key
[Framework
