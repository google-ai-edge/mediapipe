**Attention:** *Thanks for your interest in MediaPipe! We have moved to
[https://developers.google.com/mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)
as the primary developer documentation site for MediaPipe as of April 3, 2023.*

----

Note: To interoperate with OpenCV, OpenCV 3.x to 4.1 are preferred. OpenCV
2.x currently works but interoperability support may be deprecated in the
future.

Note: If you plan to use TensorFlow calculators and example apps, there is a
known issue with gcc and g++ version 6.3 and 7.3. Please use other versions.

Note: To make Mediapipe work with TensorFlow, please set Python 3.7 as the
default Python version and install the Python "six" library by running `pip3
install --user six`.

## Installing on Debian and Ubuntu

1.  Install Bazelisk.

    Follow the official
    [Bazel documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html)
    to install Bazelisk.

2.  Checkout MediaPipe repository.

    ```bash
    $ cd $HOME
    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/mediapipe.git

    # Change directory into MediaPipe root directory
    $ cd mediapipe
    ```

3.  Install OpenCV and FFmpeg.

    **Option 1**. Use package manager tool to install the pre-compiled OpenCV
    libraries. FFmpeg will be installed via `libopencv-video-dev`.

    OS                   | OpenCV
    -------------------- | ------
    Debian 9 (stretch)   | 2.4
    Debian 10 (buster)   | 3.2
    Debian 11 (bullseye) | 4.5
    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS     | 2.4
    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS     | 3.2
    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS     | 4.2
    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS     | 4.2
    Ubuntu 21.04         | 4.5

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install -y \
        libopencv-core-dev \
        libopencv-highgui-dev \
        libopencv-calib3d-dev \
        libopencv-features2d-dev \
        libopencv-imgproc-dev \
        libopencv-video-dev
    ```

    **Note**. On Debian 11/Ubuntu 21.04 where OpenCV 4.5 is installed with
    `libopencv-video-dev`, `libopencv-contrib-dev` should also be installed.

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-contrib-dev
    ```

    MediaPipe's [`opencv_linux.BUILD`] and [`WORKSPACE`] are already configured
    for OpenCV 2/3 and should work correctly on any architecture:

    ```bash
    # WORKSPACE
    new_local_repository(
      name = "linux_opencv",
      build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
      path = "/usr",
    )

    # opencv_linux.BUILD for OpenCV 2/3 installed from Debian package
    cc_library(
      name = "opencv",
      linkopts = [
        "-l:libopencv_core.so",
        "-l:libopencv_calib3d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_features2d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_highgui.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgproc.so",
        "-l:libopencv_video.so",
        "-l:libopencv_videoio.so",
      ],
    )
    ```

    For OpenCV 4 you need to modify [`opencv_linux.BUILD`] taking into account
    current architecture:

    ```bash
    # WORKSPACE
    new_local_repository(
      name = "linux_opencv",
      build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
      path = "/usr",
    )

    # opencv_linux.BUILD for OpenCV 4 installed from Debian package
    cc_library(
      name = "opencv",
      hdrs = glob([
        # Uncomment according to your multiarch value (gcc -print-multiarch):
        #  "include/aarch64-linux-gnu/opencv4/opencv2/cvconfig.h",
        #  "include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/opencv4/opencv2/cvconfig.h",
        #  "include/x86_64-linux-gnu/opencv4/opencv2/cvconfig.h",
        "include/opencv4/opencv2/**/*.h*",
      ]),
      includes = [
        # Uncomment according to your multiarch value (gcc -print-multiarch):
        #  "include/aarch64-linux-gnu/opencv4/",
        #  "include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/opencv4/",
        #  "include/x86_64-linux-gnu/opencv4/",
        "include/opencv4/",
      ],
      linkopts = [
        "-l:libopencv_core.so",
        "-l:libopencv_calib3d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_features2d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_highgui.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgproc.so",
        "-l:libopencv_video.so",
        "-l:libopencv_videoio.so",
      ],
    )
    ```

    **Option 2**. Run [`setup_opencv.sh`] to automatically build OpenCV from
    source and modify MediaPipe's OpenCV config. This option will do all steps
    defined in Option 3 automatically.

    **Option 3**. Follow OpenCV's
    [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.6/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
    to manually build OpenCV from source code.

    You may need to modify [`WORKSPACE`] and [`opencv_linux.BUILD`] to point
    MediaPipe to your own OpenCV libraries. Assume OpenCV would be installed to
    `/usr/local/` which is recommended by default.

    OpenCV 2/3 setup:

    ```bash
    # WORKSPACE
    new_local_repository(
      name = "linux_opencv",
      build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
      path = "/usr/local",
    )

    # opencv_linux.BUILD for OpenCV 2/3 installed to /usr/local
    cc_library(
      name = "opencv",
      linkopts = [
        "-L/usr/local/lib",
        "-l:libopencv_core.so",
        "-l:libopencv_calib3d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_features2d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_highgui.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgproc.so",
        "-l:libopencv_video.so",
        "-l:libopencv_videoio.so",
      ],
    )
    ```

    OpenCV 4 setup:

    ```bash
    # WORKSPACE
    new_local_repository(
      name = "linux_opencv",
      build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
      path = "/usr/local",
    )

    # opencv_linux.BUILD for OpenCV 4 installed to /usr/local
    cc_library(
      name = "opencv",
      hdrs = glob([
        "include/opencv4/opencv2/**/*.h*",
      ]),
      includes = [
        "include/opencv4/",
      ],
      linkopts = [
        "-L/usr/local/lib",
        "-l:libopencv_core.so",
        "-l:libopencv_calib3d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_features2d.so",
        "-l:libopencv_highgui.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
        "-l:libopencv_imgproc.so",
        "-l:libopencv_video.so",
        "-l:libopencv_videoio.so",
      ],
    )
    ```

    Current FFmpeg setup is defined in [`ffmpeg_linux.BUILD`] and should work
    for any architecture:

    ```bash
    # WORKSPACE
    new_local_repository(
      name = "linux_ffmpeg",
      build_file = "@//third_party:ffmpeg_linux.BUILD",
      path = "/usr"
    )

    # ffmpeg_linux.BUILD for FFmpeg installed from Debian package
    cc_library(
      name = "libffmpeg",
      linkopts = [
        "-l:libavcodec.so",
        "-l:libavformat.so",
        "-l:libavutil.so",
      ],
    )
    ```

4.  For running desktop examples on Linux only (not on OS X) with GPU
    acceleration.

    ```bash
    # Requires a GPU with EGL driver support.
    # Can use mesa GPU libraries for desktop, (or Nvidia/AMD equivalent).
    sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev

    # To compile with GPU support, replace
    --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1
    # with
    --copt -DMESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS --copt -DEGL_NO_X11
    # when building GPU examples.
    ```

5.  Run the [Hello World! in C++ example](./hello_world_cpp.md).

    ```bash
    $ export GLOG_logtostderr=1

    # if you are running on Linux desktop with CPU only
    $ bazel run --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 \
        mediapipe/examples/desktop/hello_world:hello_world

    # If you are running on Linux desktop with GPU support enabled (via mesa drivers)
    $ bazel run --copt -DMESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS --copt -DEGL_NO_X11 \
        mediapipe/examples/desktop/hello_world:hello_world

    # Should print:
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    ```

If you run into a build error, please read
[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) to find the solutions of several common
build issues.

## Installing on CentOS

**Disclaimer**: Running MediaPipe on CentOS is experimental.

1.  Install Bazelisk.

    Follow the official
    [Bazel documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html)
    to install Bazelisk.

2.  Checkout MediaPipe repository.

    ```bash
    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/mediapipe.git

    # Change directory into MediaPipe root directory
    $ cd mediapipe
    ```

3.  Install OpenCV.

    Option 1. Use package manager tool to install the pre-compiled version.

    Note: yum installs OpenCV 2.4.5, which may have an opencv/gstreamer
    [issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/4592).

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install opencv-devel
    ```

    Option 2. Build OpenCV from source code.

    Note: You may need to modify [`WORKSPACE`], [`opencv_linux.BUILD`] and
    [`ffmpeg_linux.BUILD`] to point MediaPipe to your own OpenCV and FFmpeg
    libraries. For example if OpenCV and FFmpeg are both manually installed in
    "/usr/local/", you will need to update: (1) the "linux_opencv" and
    "linux_ffmpeg" new_local_repository rules in [`WORKSPACE`], (2) the "opencv"
    cc_library rule in [`opencv_linux.BUILD`], and (3) the "libffmpeg"
    cc_library rule in [`ffmpeg_linux.BUILD`]. These 3 changes are shown below:

    ```bash
    new_local_repository(
        name = "linux_opencv",
        build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
        path = "/usr/local",
    )

    new_local_repository(
        name = "linux_ffmpeg",
        build_file = "@//third_party:ffmpeg_linux.BUILD",
        path = "/usr/local",
    )

    cc_library(
        name = "opencv",
        srcs = glob(
            [
                "lib/libopencv_core.so",
                "lib/libopencv_highgui.so",
                "lib/libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
                "lib/libopencv_imgproc.so",
                "lib/libopencv_video.so",
                "lib/libopencv_videoio.so",
            ],
        ),
        hdrs = glob([
            # For OpenCV 3.x
            "include/opencv2/**/*.h*",
            # For OpenCV 4.x
            # "include/opencv4/opencv2/**/*.h*",
        ]),
        includes = [
            # For OpenCV 3.x
            "include/",
            # For OpenCV 4.x
            # "include/opencv4/",
        ],
        linkstatic = 1,
        visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    )

    cc_library(
        name = "libffmpeg",
        srcs = glob(
            [
                "lib/libav*.so",
            ],
        ),
        hdrs = glob(["include/libav*/*.h"]),
        includes = ["include"],
        linkopts = [
            "-lavcodec",
            "-lavformat",
            "-lavutil",
        ],
        linkstatic = 1,
        visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    )
    ```

4.  Run the [Hello World! in C++ example](./hello_world_cpp.md).

    ```bash
    $ export GLOG_logtostderr=1
    # Need bazel flag 'MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1' if you are running on Linux desktop with CPU only
    $ bazel run --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 \
        mediapipe/examples/desktop/hello_world:hello_world

    # Should print:
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    ```

            ],
        ),
        hdrs = glob(["local/include/opencv2/**/*.h*"]),
        includes = ["local/include/"],
        linkstatic = 1,
        visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    )

    cc_library(
        name = "libffmpeg",
        srcs = glob(
            [
                "local/lib/libav*.dylib",
            ],
        ),
        hdrs = glob(["local/include/libav*/*.h"]),

If you run into a build error, please read
[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) to find the solutions of several common
build issues.

## Installing on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Note: The pre-built OpenCV packages don't support cameras in WSL. Unless you
[compile](https://funvision.blogspot.com/2019/12/opencv-web-camera-and-video-streams-in.html)
OpenCV with FFMPEG and GStreamer in WSL, the live demos won't work with any
cameras. Alternatively, you use a video file as input.

1.  Follow the
    [instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to
    install Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu).

2.  Install Windows ADB and start the ADB server in Windows.

    Note: Windows' and WSL’s adb versions must be the same version, e.g., if WSL
    has ADB 1.0.39, you need to download the corresponding Windows ADB from
    [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows.zip).

3.  Launch WSL.

    Note: All the following steps will be executed in WSL. The Windows directory
    of the Linux Subsystem can be found in
    C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_SomeID\LocalState\rootfs\home

4.  Install the needed packages.

    ```bash
    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git python zip adb openjdk-8-jdk
    ```

5.  Install Bazelisk.

    Follow the official
    [Bazel documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html)
    to install Bazelisk.

6.  Checkout MediaPipe repository.

    ```bash
    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/mediapipe.git

    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~$ cd mediapipe
    ```

7.  Install OpenCV and FFmpeg.

    Option 1. Use package manager tool to install the pre-compiled OpenCV
    libraries. FFmpeg will be installed via libopencv-video-dev.

    ```bash
    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~/mediapipe$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-core-dev libopencv-highgui-dev \
                           libopencv-calib3d-dev libopencv-features2d-dev \
                           libopencv-imgproc-dev libopencv-video-dev
    ```

    Option 2. Run [`setup_opencv.sh`] to automatically build OpenCV from source
    and modify MediaPipe's OpenCV config.

    Option 3. Follow OpenCV's
    [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.6/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
    to manually build OpenCV from source code.

    Note: You may need to modify [`WORKSPACE`] and [`opencv_linux.BUILD`] to
    point MediaPipe to your own OpenCV libraries, e.g., if OpenCV 4 is installed
    in "/usr/local/", you need to update the "linux_opencv" new_local_repository
    rule in [`WORKSPACE`] and "opencv" cc_library rule in [`opencv_linux.BUILD`]
    like the following:

    ```bash
    new_local_repository(
        name = "linux_opencv",
        build_file = "@//third_party:opencv_linux.BUILD",
        path = "/usr/local",
    )

    cc_library(
        name = "opencv",
        srcs = glob(
            [
                "lib/libopencv_core.so",
                "lib/libopencv_highgui.so",
                "lib/libopencv_imgcodecs.so",
                "lib/libopencv_imgproc.so",
                "lib/libopencv_video.so",
                "lib/libopencv_videoio.so",
            ],
        ),
        hdrs = glob(["include/opencv4/**/*.h*"]),
        includes = ["include/opencv4/"],
        linkstatic = 1,
        visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    )
    ```

8.  Run the [Hello World! in C++ example](./hello_world_cpp.md).

    ```bash
    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~/mediapipe$ export GLOG_logtostderr=1

    # Need bazel flag 'MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1' as desktop GPU is currently not supported
    username@DESKTOP-TMVLBJ1:~/mediapipe$ bazel run --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 \
        mediapipe/examples/desktop/hello_world:hello_world

    # Should print:
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    # Hello World!
    ```
